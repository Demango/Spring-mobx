This project was adapted from [The spring.io react rest tutorial](https://github.com/spring-guides/tut-react-and-spring-data-rest/tree/master/basic)

Start:  
Run `.\mvnw spring-boot:run`, once done navigate to http://localhost:8080

You may also run `yarn run watch` in a separate terminal to regenerate your front-end bundle when making changes.  

Tests:  
run `yarn run test` to run a single test,  
`yarn run watch-test` to watch your test files and re-run tests when they change or  
`yarn run cover` to generate a test coverage report

In case you haven't done this already, you will probably need jdk 8 installed in your path.
