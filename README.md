This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [SPRING INITIALIZR](https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/)

Start:
Run `yarn install && yarn start` and `./mvnw spring-boot:run` in separate terminals, once done navigate to http://localhost:3000
Please note that http://localhost:3000/api is proxied to http://localhost:8080/api

NB: This is as cobbled together as it gets, there is plenty completely useless code strewn about, watch your step :)
