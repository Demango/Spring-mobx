This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [SPRING INITIALIZR](https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/)

Start:  
Run `yarn install` and `yarn start` as well as `./mvnw spring-boot:run` in a separate terminal,  
once done navigate to http://localhost:3000  
Please note that http://localhost:3000/api is proxied to http://localhost:8080/api  

In case you haven't done this already, you will probably need jdk 8 installed in your path.

Footnote: this is as cobbled together as it gets, there is plenty completely useless code strewn about, watch your step :)
