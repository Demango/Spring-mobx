This project was adapted from [The spring.io react rest tutorial](https://github.com/spring-guides/tut-react-and-spring-data-rest/tree/master/basic)

Start:
Run `.\mvnw spring-boot:run` once done navigate to http://localhost:8080

You may also run `npm run watch` in a separate terminal to regenerate your front-end bundle when making changes

In case you haven't done this already, you will probably need jdk 8 installed in your path.
